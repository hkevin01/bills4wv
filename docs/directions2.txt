Here are some common Firebase commands and examples of how to use them for various tasks, including viewing your website, saving your project to GitHub, accessing the Firebase console, and other useful commands.

### 1. Viewing Your Website

After deploying your website, Firebase provides a URL. To view it:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Once deployed, youâ€™ll see output in the terminal like:

```
Hosting URL: https://<your-project-id>.web.app
```

You can open this URL in a web browser to view your website.

### 2. Saving Your Project to GitHub

To save your project to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Your Files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Add a Remote Repository** (replace `<your-repo-url>` with your actual GitHub repo URL):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### 3. Viewing the Firebase Console

To access the Firebase Console:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Log in with your Google account.
3. Select your project from the list to view its settings and configurations.

### 4. Other Common Firebase Commands

Here are some additional commonly used Firebase commands:

- **Login to Firebase**:
  ```bash
  firebase login
  ```

- **List All Projects**:
  ```bash
  firebase projects:list
  ```

- **Serve Your App Locally**:
  ```bash
  firebase serve
  ```
  This command runs a local server to preview your app before deploying.

- **Open the Firebase Console**:
  ```bash
  firebase open
  ```
  This opens your Firebase project in the web browser.

- **Deploy Only Hosting**:
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only hosting
  ```

- **View Logs**:
  ```bash
  firebase functions:log
  ```

- **Emulate Firebase Services**:
  ```bash
  firebase emulators:start
  ```
  This command allows you to run Firebase services locally for development and testing.

### Conclusion

These commands will help you manage your Firebase project effectively, view your website, and integrate with GitHub. For more details, refer to the [Firebase CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).
